<p>I discovered computer programming when I was 17, and I was in my junior year of high school(last semester also I did online school at home)
at first I thought myself maybe this was a better thing I could do in my future life as the workforce could go into tech jobs as I get older. The first coding learning I've used was freecodecamp(link is on the websites page along with others) with freecodecamp it teaches you how to code like developing websites, designing websites, css codes, etc. then after I finished high school(although I've done freecodecamp during my free time while I was still in school), and I felt that I needed more practice so I've also used other websites like Udemy, Codecademy, and practiced coding on my computer using a basic text editor called notepad where I can do it all on my own. As of now I am getting closer to finding a job as a front end developer as my coding skills are good, and it's just the basics, also python is what I am also learning as well. That's all for now if you want to find and discover some coding websites feel free to take a look at them and see what you think. good luck!
